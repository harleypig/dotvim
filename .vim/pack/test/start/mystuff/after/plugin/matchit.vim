"  matchit         $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.vim

" This is included in the vim distribution, but I've put it in my bundle
" directory to be less confusing to myself.

" I've set a matchit for if/elsif/else in after/ftplugin/perl.vim and vim-perl
" has a match_skip in bundle/vim-perl/ftplugin/perl.vim.
