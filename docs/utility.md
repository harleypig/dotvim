# Utility Plugins

This document lists utility plugins that enhance the Vim experience by
providing specific functionalities. These utilities are documented here
because they are more specific in their application compared to global plugins
that affect the entire Vim environment.

## TODO

* Create conventions in the aider-conventions.md document for documenting
    utility plugins.
* Split the documented utility plugins into their own sections for more
    detailed information.

## Existing Utility Plugins

The following utility plugins, already installed and configured in this Vim
environment, are linked to their respective homepages or repositories:

* [**gitgutter**](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter): A plugin that shows a git diff in the gutter (sign column) and stages/undoes hunks.

* [**fzf**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A command-line fuzzy finder integrated with Vim, used for searching and opening files.

* [**fugitive**](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): A Git wrapper for Vim, which provides Git integration directly within the editor.

Each utility is linked to its respective homepage or repository for more information and documentation.
