Core Requirements for Language and Configuration Management

The following features are generally applicable to any programming language or configuration system to enhance productivity and code quality:

1. Syntax Highlighting: Visually distinguish elements for better readability.
2. Linting and Static Analysis: Analyze code for potential errors and code quality.
3. Auto-Completion: Suggest code elements based on the current context.
4. Formatting and Beautification: Automatically format code in a consistent style.
5. Error Highlighting: Visually indicate issues that need attention.
6. Code Folding: Collapse sections of code for easier navigation.
7. Snippets: Insert common patterns and boilerplate quickly.
8. Schema or Contract Validation: Adhere to predefined standards and structures.
9. Integration with External Tools: Utilize additional functionalities from external utilities.
10. Version Control Integration: Track and compare changes within version control systems.
11. Comment Support: Include comments for explanatory notes, even in formats that do not traditionally support them (e.g., JSONC for JSON).
12. Filetype Detection: Automatically apply the correct settings and tools when opening files.
