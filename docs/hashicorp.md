## HashiCorp Configuration

This document outlines the setup and configuration for HashiCorp tools used
within this development environment, specifically focusing on Terraform,
Packer, and the Terraform testing framework.

### External Packages Used

For working with HashiCorp tools, the following external packages are used:

- **Terraform**: Provides infrastructure as code to define and provision data
    center infrastructure.

- **Packer**: Enables the creation of machine and container images for
    multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

- **terraform-ls**: Provides language server support for Terraform files,
    offering features like auto-completion, document formatting, and
    diagnostics.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

The following plugins and extensions are used for HashiCorp tooling support:

- **vim-terraform**: Provides syntax highlighting, formatting, and other features for Terraform files.
- **ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine)**: Used for linting Terraform files with `tflint`.
- **CoC (Conqueror of Completion)**: Provides auto-completion and language server integration for Terraform via `coc-terraform`.
