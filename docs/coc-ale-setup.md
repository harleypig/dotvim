# ALE and CoC Setup

ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) and CoC (Conqueror of Completion) are both essential plugins for Vim that enhance the coding experience by providing linting and intelligent code completion features. While ALE focuses on asynchronous linting, allowing you to see errors and warnings in your code without blocking the editor, CoC provides an Intellisense engine that powers features like auto-completion, code navigation, and more. They differ in their primary focus but can be configured to work together harmoniously within Vim.

## Required Packages for CoC and ALE

To use CoC and ALE as configured in this repository, the following packages and tools must be installed:

- **Node.js**: Required for CoC extension host.
- **npm** or **yarn**: Package managers to install CoC extensions.
- **Language servers**: Specific to the programming languages you are using, such as `coc-pyright` for Python or `coc-tsserver` for TypeScript/JavaScript.
- **Linters and formatters**: Tools like `eslint` for JavaScript, `flake8` for Python, and `prettier` for code formatting.
- **ALE fixers**: For auto-fixing issues reported by linters, such as `isort` for Python import sorting.
- **Vim plugins**: Additional Vim plugins that integrate with ALE or CoC, such as `vim-ale-coc` for disabling ALE linting where CoC provides diagnostics.

Ensure that these tools are installed and properly configured in your environment to fully utilize the capabilities of ALE and CoC in Vim.
