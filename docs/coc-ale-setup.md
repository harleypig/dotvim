# ALE and CoC Setup

ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) and CoC (Conqueror of Completion) are both essential plugins for Vim that enhance the coding experience by providing linting and intelligent code completion features. While ALE focuses on asynchronous linting, allowing you to see errors and warnings in your code without blocking the editor, CoC provides an Intellisense engine that powers features like auto-completion, code navigation, and more. They differ in their primary focus but can be configured to work together harmoniously within Vim.

## Required Packages for CoC and ALE

To use CoC and ALE as they are configured in this repository, the following packages must be installed:
