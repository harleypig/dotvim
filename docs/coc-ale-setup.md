# ALE and CoC Setup

ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) and CoC (Conqueror of Completion) are both essential plugins for Vim that enhance the coding experience by providing linting and intelligent code completion features. While ALE focuses on asynchronous linting, allowing you to see errors and warnings in your code without blocking the editor, CoC provides an Intellisense engine that powers features like auto-completion, code navigation, and more. They differ in their primary focus but can be configured to work together harmoniously within Vim.

## Required Packages for CoC and ALE

To use CoC and ALE as they are configured in this repository, the following packages must be installed:

- **Node.js**: Required for running the CoC extension host.
- **npm** or **yarn**: Used to install CoC extensions.

### Node.js Installation Options

For installing Node.js, you can either:

- Use **nvm** (Node Version Manager) to install and manage multiple Node.js versions.
- Use the **nodesource** repository to install a specific version of Node.js.
- **npm** or **yarn**: Used to install CoC extensions.

Ensure that Node.js and a package manager like npm or yarn are installed and properly configured in your environment to fully utilize the capabilities of ALE and CoC in Vim.

## ALE and CoC Configuration Settings

The settings for ALE and CoC are distributed across several files within this repository. Here is a broad overview of the configuration:

- **ALE Settings**: ALE settings are primarily located in `.vim/pack/settings/start/settings/plugin/ale.vim`. This file contains ALE-specific Vimscript settings such as disabling linting when CoC is active, setting linting behaviors, and defining ALE fixers.

- **CoC Settings**: CoC's main configuration is found in `.vim/coc-settings.json`, which is a JSON file that dictates the behavior of CoC features, including diagnostics display, formatting, and language server configurations.

- **Filetype-specific Settings**: Both ALE and CoC can have filetype-specific settings. These are located in files within the `.vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/` directory, where each file corresponds to a particular filetype and contains settings and fixers relevant to that filetype.

These configuration files are designed to work together to provide a seamless experience when using ALE and CoC in Vim. They can be customized further to fit the needs of individual development environments.

Ensure that these tools are installed and properly configured in your environment to fully utilize the capabilities of ALE and CoC in Vim.
