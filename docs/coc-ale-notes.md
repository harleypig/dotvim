# Using coc.nvim and ALE together

ALE has a good paragraph on the [subject](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale#faq-coc-nvim):

- ALE is primarily focused on integrating with external programs through
  virtually any means, provided the plugin remains almost entirely written
  in Vim script.
- coc.nvim is primarily focused on bringing IDE features to Vim.
