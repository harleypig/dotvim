# Global Defaults

This file documents global defaults across languages and configurations. This
file does **not** document plugin defaults. Read the documentation for the
plugin you're interested in for that information.

## CoC and ALE

* CoC manages linting
* ALE manages formatting

TODO: Create and document configuration and mappings to be used globally.

## Special Windows

For purposes of this document, we're only concerned with quick list and
location list windows.

Errors (syntax, linting, compiling, etc.) go in location list windows. CoC and
ALE are configured to follow this convention; double check when making changes
this is not altered.
