# Global Defaults

This file serves a dual purpose: it documents global defaults across languages
and configurations for human reference, and it also provides instructions for
AI systems to understand and apply these settings. It does **not** document
plugin defaults. For plugin-specific settings, refer to the respective plugin
documentation.

## CoC and ALE

* CoC manages linting
* ALE manages formatting

TODO: Define and document the configuration and mappings that apply globally,
ensuring they are clear and actionable for both human and AI implementation.

## Special Windows

For purposes of this document, we're only concerned with quick list and
location list windows.

Errors (syntax, linting, compiling, etc.) go in location list windows. CoC and
ALE are configured to follow this convention; double check when making changes
this is not altered.
