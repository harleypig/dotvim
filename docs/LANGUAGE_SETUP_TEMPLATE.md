# Language/Environment [NAME]

This template provides a checklist for setting up development tools for
a specific programming language or environment.

Create a short description this language or environment.

Wherever possible, use vim builtin settings/configuration options. If it's
possible to use a setting but a third-party solution is selected, document the
possible setting or configuration and explain why the third-part solution was
chosen.

If multiple third-party solutions were evaluated, or a solution was changed,
document why the change was made.
