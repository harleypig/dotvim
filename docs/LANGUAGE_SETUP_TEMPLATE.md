## [NAME]

This document outlines the support for [NAME] development within the Vim environment.

Note: Prefer Vim's built-in functionality when available. Document why external
tools were chosen over built-in options when applicable. Include rationale for
tool selection or changes if multiple solutions were evaluated.

### External Packages Used

* [package-name](link) - Brief description of the package and its purpose in
    the development workflow.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

* [plugin-name](link) (Plugin/Extension type) - Brief description including
    supported features (e.g., linting, completion, syntax).

### Configuration Files Used

* [filename](/path/to/file) - Purpose and scope of the configuration
* `coc-settings` - Use `:CocConfig` to edit this file.
