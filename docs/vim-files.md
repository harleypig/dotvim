## Vim Files Configuration

This document outlines the plugins, extensions, and settings used specifically for editing Vim configuration files within this development environment.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (Vim Plugin Manager): Used to manage other Vim plugins.
- [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) (Vim Plugin): Provides sensible default settings for Vim.
- [vim-vimlparser](https://github.com/vim-jp/vim-vimlparser) (Vim Plugin): A VimL parser that can be used for linting Vim script files.

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for Vim script files is provided by Vim's built-in support for the `vim` filetype.

### Linting and Static Analysis

- **ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine)**: ALE is configured to use `vint` for linting Vim script files.

### Auto Completion

- **coc.nvim (Conqueror of Completion)**: CoC is configured with the `coc-vimlsp` extension to provide auto-completion for Vim script files.

### Formatting and Beautification

Formatting for Vim script files is handled manually, as there is no specific formatter set up for this filetype in the current configuration.

### Error Highlighting

Error highlighting for Vim script files is provided by ALE with the `vint` linter.

### Code Folding

Code folding is managed by Vim's built-in `foldmethod` setting, which can be set to `syntax` for Vim script files to allow folding based on syntax.

### Filetype Detection

Vim automatically detects `*.vim` files as Vim script files. Custom filetype detection can be added in `.vim/ftdetect/` if needed.

### Version Control Integration

Version control for Vim configuration files is managed by Git, with the repository containing a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

### Comment Support

Commenting in Vim script files is done using the `"` character. Plugins like `nerdcommenter` can be used to provide enhanced commenting capabilities.

### Settings

The following settings are specific to Vim script files and are set in the `.vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/vim.vim` file:

```vim
" Enable ALE for linting Vim script files
let b:ale_linters['vim'] = ['vint']

" Use vim-language-server for Vim script files
let b:ale_vim_vimls_executable = 'vim-language-server'
let b:ale_vim_vimls_use_global = 1
```
