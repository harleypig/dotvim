## Ansible

This document outlines the support for Ansible development within the Vim
environment, integrating the `coc-ansible` extension for enhanced
functionality.

### External Packages Used

* [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - Automation tool for provisioning,
    configuration management, and deployment.
* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) - Lints
    Ansible playbooks for best practices and potential errors.
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - Linter for YAML files
    to ensure consistent formatting.
* [ansible-language-server](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-language-server)
    - Provides language features like auto-completion and linting for Ansible.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

* [@yaegassy/coc-ansible](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-ansible) (CoC
    Extension) - Provides auto-completion, linting, and other language features
    for Ansible.
* [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) (Vim Plugin)
    - A collection of language packs for Vim, which includes support for
    Ansible syntax highlighting and filetype detection.

### Configuration Files Used

* [yaml.vim](/vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/yaml.vim) - Configures
    Vim to recognize YAML files, which are commonly used by Ansible.
* `coc-settings` - Use `:CocConfig` to edit this file.

### Syntax Highlighting

Ansible syntax is highlighted through the `vim-polyglot` plugin.

### Linting and Static Analysis

`ansible-lint` is integrated through the `coc-ansible` extension and provides
automated, as-you-type linting for Ansible playbooks.

`yamllint` is included as part of the `ansible-lint` checks, ensuring YAML
files adhere to consistent formatting standards.

### Auto Completion

The `coc-ansible` extension, which uses `ansible-language-server`, provides
auto-completion features for Ansible.

### Formatting and Beautification

Formatting and beautification for Ansible files can be achieved using tools like `ansible-lint` with specific rules for code style, or other YAML formatters that ensure consistent formatting across Ansible playbooks. These tools can be integrated into the Vim environment and can be run manually or automatically on file save, depending on user configuration.
