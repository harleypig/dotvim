## Ansible

This document outlines the support for Ansible development within the Vim environment.

### External Packages Used
- ansible
- ansible-lint
- yamllint

### Plugins and Extensions Used
[vim-ansible](https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim) (vim plugin) - Provides Ansible syntax highlighting.
[coc-ansible](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#implemented-coc-extensions) (coc extension) - Offers auto-completion and other language features for Ansible.

### Configuration Files Used
- .vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/yaml.vim - Configures Vim to recognize YAML files, which are commonly used by Ansible.

### Language Server
- No specific language server for Ansible, but YAML language servers can be used to enhance development experience.

### Syntax Highlighting
- Enabled by the vim-ansible plugin.

### Linting and Static Analysis
- ansible-lint and yamllint can be integrated with Vim using ALE or CoC to provide linting and static analysis.

### Auto Completion
- Provided by the coc-ansible extension through CoC.

### Formatting and Beautification
- No specific formatter for Ansible, but YAML formatters can be used to format Ansible playbooks and roles.

### Error Highlighting
- ALE or CoC can be configured to highlight errors using ansible-lint and yamllint.

### Code Folding
- Vim's built-in code folding can be used to fold YAML structures in Ansible playbooks.

### Snippets
- Snippets for Ansible tasks can be added to UltiSnips or a similar snippet plugin.

### Schema or Contract Validation
- No specific schema validation for Ansible, but YAML schemas can be validated using a YAML language server.

### Version Control Integration
- Vim's built-in features or plugins like fugitive.vim can be used for version control integration.

### Comment Support
- Vim's built-in comment support for YAML files applies to Ansible playbooks as well.

### Filetype Detection
- Vim automatically detects .yml and .yaml files. Additional configuration can be added for Ansible-specific file types.

This setup ensures a robust development environment for Ansible within Vim, leveraging the power of plugins and extensions to provide a rich set of features.
