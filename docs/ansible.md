## Ansible

This document outlines the support for Ansible development within the Vim environment, integrating the `coc-ansible` extension for enhanced functionality.

### External Packages Used
- ansible
- ansible-lint
- yamllint

### Plugins and Extensions Used
* [coc-ansible](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-ansible) (coc extension) - Provides auto-completion, linting, and other language features for Ansible, using the `ansible-language-server`.
* [vim-ansible](https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim) (vim plugin) - Provides Ansible syntax highlighting and sets the `yaml.ansible` filetype, which is required by `coc-ansible`.
* [coc-ansible](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#implemented-coc-extensions) (coc extension) - Offers auto-completion and other language features for Ansible.

### Configuration Files Used

- .vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/yaml.vim - Configures Vim to recognize YAML files, which are commonly used by Ansible.

### Language Server and Linting

* [ansible-language-server](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-language-server) - Provides features like auto-completion, linting, and syntax highlighting for Ansible. It is used by the `coc-ansible` extension.

- No specific language server for Ansible, but YAML language servers can be used to enhance development experience.

### Syntax Highlighting

- Enabled by the vim-ansible plugin.

### Linting and Static Analysis

* ansible-lint and yamllint can be integrated using ALE or CoC. `coc-ansible` can also perform linting with `ansible-lint` and optionally with `yamllint` if it is installed.

- ansible-lint and yamllint can be integrated with Vim using ALE or CoC to provide linting and static analysis.

### Auto Completion
* Auto-completion for Ansible is provided by `coc-ansible`, which utilizes the `ansible-language-server`.
- Provided by the coc-ansible extension through CoC.

### Formatting and Beautification

* None specific for Ansible, but YAML formatting tools can be used. `coc-ansible` provides a built-in installation option for `ansible-lint` and `yamllint`.

- No specific formatter for Ansible, but YAML formatters can be used to format Ansible playbooks and roles.

### Error Highlighting and Code Actions

- ALE or CoC can be configured to highlight errors using ansible-lint and yamllint.

### Code Folding

* Built-in Vim settings can be used for folding YAML structures.

- Vim's built-in code folding can be used to fold YAML structures in Ansible playbooks.

### Snippets and Commands

- Snippets for Ansible tasks can be added to UltiSnips or a similar snippet plugin.

### Schema or Contract Validation

* None specific for Ansible, but YAML schemas can be validated using a YAML language server.

- No specific schema validation for Ansible, but YAML schemas can be validated using a YAML language server.

### Version Control Integration and Configuration Options

- Vim's built-in features or plugins like fugitive.vim can be used for version control integration.

### Comment Support

* Built-in Vim settings for YAML files provide comment support.

- Vim's built-in comment support for YAML files applies to Ansible playbooks as well.

### Filetype Detection and Built-in Installation

- Vim automatically detects .yml and .yaml files. Additional configuration can be added for Ansible-specific file types.
* Vim automatically detects .yml and .yaml files. The `vim-ansible` plugin sets the `yaml.ansible` filetype, which is required by `coc-ansible`.

This setup ensures a robust development environment for Ansible within Vim, leveraging the power of plugins and extensions to provide a rich set of features.

### Built-in Installation

* `coc-ansible` provides a built-in installation option for `ansible`, `ansible-lint`, and optionally `yamllint` within an extension-only virtual environment. This can be triggered manually with the `:CocCommand ansible.builtin.installRequirementsTools` command or will prompt on first use if these tools are not detected.

### Commands

* `coc-ansible` adds several commands to manage the Ansible development environment, such as restarting the language server, showing metadata, resyncing inventory, and displaying plugin information with `ansible-doc`.

### Configuration Options

* `coc-ansible` offers various configuration options to customize the behavior of the Ansible language server and related tools. These options can be set in the `.vim/coc-settings.json` file.

### Code Actions

* `coc-ansible` provides code actions that can be invoked with a mapped key in Vim. These actions include ignoring linting rules for the current line and showing web documentation for specific rules.
