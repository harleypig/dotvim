## Ansible

This document outlines the support for Ansible development within the Vim environment, integrating the `coc-ansible` extension for enhanced functionality.

### External Packages Used

* [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - An open-source automation tool for
    software provisioning, configuration management, and application
    deployment.
* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) - A
    command-line tool for linting playbooks to identify practices and
    behaviour that could potentially be improved.
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - A linter for YAML
    files, ensuring that they adhere to a consistent format and structure.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

* [@yaegassy/coc-ansible](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-ansible) (CoC
    Extension) - Provides auto-completion, linting, and other language features
    for Ansible.
* [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) (Vim Plugin)
    - A collection of language packs for Vim, which includes support for
    Ansible syntax highlighting and filetype detection.

### Configuration Files Used

* [yaml.vim](/vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/yaml.vim) - Configures
    Vim to recognize YAML files, which are commonly used by Ansible.
* `coc-settings` - Use `:CocConfig` to edit this file.

### Language Server

[ansible-language-server](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-language-server)
(Language Server) - An implementation of the Language Server Protocol that
provides rich language features for Ansible. It offers features such as
auto-completion, real-time linting, and syntax highlighting. Integrated with
the `coc-ansible` extension, it enhances the Ansible development experience in
Vim. Note that `ansible-language-server` is automatically managed by the
`coc-ansible` extension and does not require separate installation.

### Linting and Static Analysis

* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) - Lints Ansible playbooks, detecting errors and suggesting improvements for your code.
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - Ensures that YAML files, commonly used in Ansible playbooks, adhere to a consistent format and structure.
