## Ansible

This document outlines the support for Ansible development within the Vim
environment, integrating the `coc-ansible` extension for enhanced
functionality.

### External Packages Used

* [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - Automation tool for provisioning,
    configuration management, and deployment.
* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) - Lints
    Ansible playbooks for best practices and potential errors.
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - Linter for YAML files
    to ensure consistent formatting.
* [ansible-language-server](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-language-server)
    - Provides language features like auto-completion and linting for Ansible.

### Plugins and Extensions Used

* [@yaegassy/coc-ansible](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-ansible) (CoC
    Extension) - Provides auto-completion, linting, and other language features
    for Ansible.
* [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) (Vim Plugin)
    - A collection of language packs for Vim, which includes support for
    Ansible syntax highlighting and filetype detection.

### Configuration Files Used

* [yaml.vim](/vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/yaml.vim) - Configures
    Vim to recognize YAML files, which are commonly used by Ansible.
* `coc-settings` - Use `:CocConfig` to edit this file.

### Syntax Highlighting

Ansible syntax is highlighted through the `vim-polyglot` plugin.

### Linting and Static Analysis

* `ansible-lint` is integrated through the `coc-ansible` extension and provides automated, as-you-type linting for Ansible playbooks, enforcing best practices and identifying potential errors.
* `yamllint` is included as part of the `ansible-lint` checks, ensuring YAML files adhere to consistent formatting standards.
