## JSON

For working with JSON files in this repository, the following external packages are configured and need to be installed:

- **jq**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- **eslint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

These packages are used by the ALE plugin for linting and formatting JSON files as specified in the `.vim/pack/settings/start/settings/ftplugin/json.vim` configuration file.
